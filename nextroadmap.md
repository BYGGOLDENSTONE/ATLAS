# Atlas Development Roadmap

## Current Status
**Completed**: P0-P9 (Core combat, damage pipeline, block/vulnerability, poise/stagger, focus mode, interactables, wall impact, dash)  
**Active**: P10 - Advanced AI

## Phase 1: Complete Core Combat Foundation

### P10 - Advanced AI System âš¡ *[CURRENT]*
- Enemy combo sequences
- Soul Attack (unblockable mechanic)
- Catch Special (gap closer)
- Enemy dash ability

### P11 - Tiered Vulnerability System
- Convert current 8x multiplier to tiered system
  - **Stunned** (Yellow): 1 critical hit
  - **Crippled** (Orange): 2-3 critical hits
  - **Exposed** (Red): 3-5 critical hits
- Visual indicators per tier
- Different recovery times

---

## Phase 2: Station Integrity System

### P12 - Dual Health Bar System
- Station Integrity component and UI
- Integrity damage calculation
- Ability risk categorization (Low/Medium/High)

### P13 - Station Instability Effects
- **80% Integrity**: Lights flicker, steam leaks
- **60% Integrity**: Gravity fluctuations
- **40% Integrity**: Structural failures, floor collapses
- **20% Integrity**: Hull breaches, defensive systems activate

---

## Phase 3: Expanded Player Abilities

### P14 - Low-Risk Abilities (No Integrity Cost)
