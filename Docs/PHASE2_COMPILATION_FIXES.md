# Phase 2: C++ Room System Compilation Fixes
**Date**: 2025-01-22

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing ArrowComponent Include
**File**: `EngineeringBayRoom.cpp`
**Issue**: `UArrowComponent` was undefined
**Fix**: Added `#include "Components/ArrowComponent.h"`

### 2. FTimerHandle Lambda Capture Issues
**Files**: `EngineeringBayRoom.cpp`
**Issue**: Cannot capture FTimerHandle by value and then clear it (loses qualifiers)
**Fix**: Used heap-allocated FTimerHandle pointers for lambdas that need to clear timers

### 3. LoadLevelInstance Parameter Issue
**File**: `RoomStreamingManager.cpp`
**Issue**: `LoadLevelInstance` requires a bool& parameter, not nullptr
**Fix**: Added `bool bSuccess` variable to pass by reference

### 4. Missing PlayerCameraManager Include
**File**: `RoomStreamingManager.cpp`
**Fix**: Added includes for PlayerController and PlayerCameraManager for fade effects

## Timer Handle Best Practice

When using timers in lambdas that need to clear themselves or other timers:

```cpp
// BAD - Cannot capture by value and clear
FTimerHandle Timer;
GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(Timer, [this, Timer]() {
    GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().ClearTimer(Timer); // ERROR!
}, 1.0f, false);

// GOOD - Use heap allocation for self-clearing timers
FTimerHandle* Timer = new FTimerHandle();
GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(*Timer, [this, Timer]() {
    GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().ClearTimer(*Timer);
    delete Timer;
}, 1.0f, false);

// ALTERNATIVE - Store as member variable
// In class header:
FTimerHandle MemberTimer;
// In implementation:
GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(MemberTimer, [this]() {
    GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().ClearTimer(MemberTimer);
}, 1.0f, false);
```

## Build Instructions

1. Clean the project:
   - Delete Binaries and Intermediate folders
   
2. Regenerate project files:
   - Right-click .uproject → Generate Visual Studio project files
   
3. Build in Visual Studio:
   - Open Atlas.sln
   - Build → Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
   
4. If errors persist:
   - Check all includes are correct
   - Verify forward declarations match implementations
   - Ensure all used types are fully defined where needed

## Next Steps

After successful compilation:
1. Open Unreal Editor
2. Create Blueprint wrappers for room classes
3. Test room loading with console commands
4. Verify hazard systems work correctly

## Common Compilation Issues

### Forward Declaration vs Include
- Use forward declaration in headers when possible
- Use full includes in implementation files
- Arrow components, Box components need full includes when accessing members

### Lambda Captures
- By value: Creates copy, cannot modify original
- By reference: Can modify, but be careful with lifetimes
- Heap allocation: For complex lifetime management

### Unreal Engine API Changes
- Check engine version compatibility
- Some APIs change between UE versions
- Always check function signatures in documentation

The room system should now compile successfully!
