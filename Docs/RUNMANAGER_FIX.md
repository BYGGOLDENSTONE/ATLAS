# RunManager Not Found - Fix Applied
**Date**: 2025-01-22

## Problem
When running `Atlas.Phase3.StartRun`, the error "RunManager not found" was occurring.

## Root Cause
The `RunManagerComponent` was not attached to the `AtlasGameMode`, so when Phase3ConsoleCommands tried to find it, it returned null.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated AtlasGameMode.h
- Added `RunManagerComponent` as a protected member
- Added `GetRunManager()` public function to access it
- Added forward declaration for `URunManagerComponent`

### 2. Updated AtlasGameMode.cpp
- Created `RunManagerComponent` in constructor using `CreateDefaultSubobject`
- Added include for `Components/RunManagerComponent.h`

### 3. Updated Phase3ConsoleCommands.cpp
- Changed from `GameMode->FindComponentByClass<URunManagerComponent>()`
- To: `GameMode->GetRunManager()`

## Code Changes

### AtlasGameMode.h
```cpp
// Added forward declaration
class URunManagerComponent;

// Added to class:
public:
    URunManagerComponent* GetRunManager() const { return RunManagerComponent; }

protected:
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Components")
    URunManagerComponent* RunManagerComponent;
```

### AtlasGameMode.cpp
```cpp
// In constructor:
RunManagerComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<URunManagerComponent>(TEXT("RunManagerComponent"));
```

### Phase3ConsoleCommands.cpp
```cpp
// Changed GetRunManager() implementation:
return GameMode->GetRunManager(); // Instead of FindComponentByClass
```

## Testing
After recompiling:
1. Run `Atlas.Phase3.StartRun` - Should now work
2. Run `Atlas.Phase3.ShowRunProgress` - Should show run state
3. Run `Atlas.Phase3.QuickTest` - Should pass RunManager test

## Why This Approach
- **Components on Actors**: RunManagerComponent is an ActorComponent, which needs to be attached to an Actor (GameMode is an Actor)
- **Explicit Creation**: Components must be explicitly created in the constructor
- **Direct Access**: Providing a getter is cleaner than using FindComponentByClass

## Next Steps
1. Compile the project
2. Test the StartRun command
3. Verify room loading works with the RunManager
