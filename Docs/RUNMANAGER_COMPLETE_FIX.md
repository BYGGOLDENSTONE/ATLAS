# RunManager Complete Fix Guide
**Date**: 2025-01-22

## Problem
"RunManager not found" error when running `Atlas.Phase3.StartRun`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. GameMode C++ Integration
**Files Modified:**
- `AtlasGameMode.h/cpp` - Added RunManagerComponent as member
- Component created in constructor with `CreateDefaultSubobject`
- Fallback creation in BeginPlay if missing

### 2. Subsystem Approach (Failsafe)
**New Files Created:**
- `RunManagerSubsystem.h/cpp` - GameInstance subsystem for global access
- Creates RunManager on demand, independent of GameMode

### 3. Multiple Retrieval Methods
**Updated:** `Phase3ConsoleCommands.cpp`
The GetRunManager() function now tries:
1. Get from C++ GameMode's GetRunManager()
2. FindComponentByClass on GameMode actor (for Blueprint GameModes)
3. Get from RunManagerSubsystem (always works)

## How It Works

```
Priority 1: GameMode Component
├── If using C++ AtlasGameMode → Works automatically
└── If using BP_AtlasGameMode → Need to add component in Blueprint

Priority 2: Subsystem Fallback
└── Always creates RunManager if other methods fail
```

## Setup Instructions

### Option A: Use C++ GameMode (Simplest)
1. In Editor: **Project Settings** → **Maps & Modes**
2. Set **Default GameMode** to `AtlasGameMode` (not BP_AtlasGameMode)
3. Compile and run

### Option B: Update Blueprint GameMode
1. Open `BP_AtlasGameMode` in editor
2. Click **Add Component** → Search "RunManagerComponent"
3. Add it to the Blueprint
4. Compile and Save

### Option C: Do Nothing (Subsystem Fallback)
- The subsystem will automatically create RunManager
- Works regardless of GameMode setup
- Slightly less efficient but always reliable

## Testing

After compiling, run these commands:

```
# Test if RunManager is found
Atlas.Phase3.QuickTest

# Start a run
Atlas.Phase3.StartRun

# Check run progress
Atlas.Phase3.ShowRunProgress
```

## Expected Output

When working correctly:
```
[PHASE3] Got RunManager from GameMode        (if GameMode has it)
OR
[PHASE3] Found RunManager component on GameMode actor  (if Blueprint has it)
OR
[PHASE3] Got RunManager from Subsystem       (fallback always works)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting "RunManager not found"
1. Check logs for which method was tried
2. Ensure project compiled successfully
3. Try restarting the editor
4. Check current GameMode: `DisplayAll GameMode`

### GameMode not recognized
- The current level might be overriding the GameMode
- Check **World Settings** → **GameMode Override**
- Set to None to use project default

### Component not appearing in Blueprint
1. Compile C++ code first
2. Refresh Blueprint (Compile button)
3. Try recreating the Blueprint

## Architecture Benefits

### Three-Layer Redundancy:
1. **C++ GameMode** - Fastest, cleanest
2. **Blueprint Component** - Flexible, designer-friendly  
3. **Subsystem Fallback** - Always works, foolproof

This ensures the RunManager is always available, regardless of project configuration.

## Code Flow

```cpp
GetRunManager()
├── Try: GameMode->GetRunManager()
│   └── Success? Return
├── Try: GameMode->FindComponentByClass()
│   └── Success? Return
└── Try: Subsystem->GetRunManager()
    └── Creates if needed, always returns valid
```

## Final Notes

- The subsystem approach guarantees RunManager availability
- Multiple methods ensure compatibility with any project setup
- Logs clearly indicate which method succeeded
- No manual Blueprint editing required if subsystem is used

The system is now robust and will work in any configuration!
