# Atlas Architecture Improvements

## Summary of Refactoring
This document outlines the architectural improvements made to the Atlas codebase to address identified issues and improve maintainability.

## 1. UniversalAction Routing Refactor ✅
**Problem**: Large if/else chain for action type routing was difficult to maintain and extend.

**Solution**: Implemented function pointer map pattern
- Added `ActionExecutorMap` to map action tags to execution functions
- Created dedicated execution methods for each action type
- Implemented `ExecuteActionByType()` for cleaner routing
- Added fallback to ActionType enum for unmapped actions

**Benefits**:
- O(1) lookup instead of O(n) comparisons
- Easy to add new actions without modifying routing logic
- Clear separation of concerns for each action type

## 2. Data-Driven Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Magic numbers and hardcoded values throughout action implementations.

**Solution**: Extended ActionDataAsset with comprehensive configuration fields
- Added `ActionDuration` for timing control
- Added `MontagePlayRate` for animation speed control
- Added `AttackWindupTime` and `AttackRecoveryTime` for combat timing
- Added `bCanBeInterrupted` and `bAutoReleaseOnComplete` for behavior control
- Added `bIsToggleAction` for toggle-style abilities
- Added `InputBufferWindow` for action queueing
- Added montage section control fields

**Benefits**:
- Designers can tweak values without code changes
- Consistent behavior across all actions
- Better balance control

## 3. Interface-Based Communication ✅
**Problem**: Circular dependencies between components (Combat ↔ Health ↔ Vulnerability).

**Solution**: Created three core interfaces
- `ICombatInterface`: Combat state and action management
- `IHealthInterface`: Health queries and modification
- `IActionInterface`: Action system interaction

**Implementation**:
- GameCharacterBase now implements all three interfaces
- Components communicate through interfaces instead of direct includes
- BaseAction uses interfaces for tag checking

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated circular dependencies
- Components are now loosely coupled
- Easier to test components in isolation
- Can swap implementations without breaking dependencies

## 4. Component Architecture Documentation ✅
**Problem**: Component dependencies were unclear and undocumented.

**Solution**: 
- Analyzed all component includes and dependencies
- Created interface layer to abstract component communication
- Documented dependency flow

**Current Architecture**:
```
GameCharacterBase (implements interfaces)
    ├── ActionManagerComponent (manages actions)
    ├── CombatComponent (legacy, being phased out)
    ├── HealthComponent (health/poise management)
    └── Interfaces
        ├── ICombatInterface
        ├── IHealthInterface
        └── IActionInterface
```

## 5. Action System Improvements ✅
**Enhanced Features**:
- Universal action timer replacing separate dash/attack timers
- Channel progress tracking for channeled abilities
- Proper montage section and playback rate support
- Station integrity cost application moved to action activation
- Toggle action support for abilities like Focus Mode

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify all 15 abilities work with new routing system
- [ ] Test action interruption with `bCanBeInterrupted` flag
- [ ] Verify toggle actions (Focus Mode) work correctly
- [ ] Test montage playback rates
- [ ] Verify station integrity costs are applied
- [ ] Test action cooldowns work properly
- [ ] Verify interfaces provide correct data
- [ ] Test that components no longer have circular dependencies
- [ ] Verify attack windup and recovery times
- [ ] Test input buffering window

## Compilation Notes
After these changes, you should:
1. Recompile the entire project
2. Regenerate project files if needed
3. Create/update ActionDataAssets with new fields
4. Test each ability systematically

## Future Improvements
1. **Complete CombatComponent Migration**: Move remaining attack/block logic to UniversalAction
2. **Action Queueing System**: Implement proper input buffering using `InputBufferWindow`
3. **Visual Feedback System**: Add progress bars for channeled abilities
4. **Performance Profiling**: Measure impact of interface calls vs direct access
5. **Blueprint Exposure**: Ensure all new features are accessible in Blueprint

## Performance Considerations
- Interface calls have minimal overhead in C++
- Function pointer map is more efficient than if/else chains
- Caching component references during action execution reduces lookups
- Data-driven approach reduces recompilation needs

## Migration Guide for Existing Actions
1. Update any custom action classes to use new data fields
2. Replace direct component access with interface calls
3. Use `ActionTimer` instead of custom timers
4. Leverage `ExecuteActionByType()` for routing

## API Changes
### Deprecated:
- Direct component includes in actions
- Separate dash/attack timers
- Hardcoded timing values

### New:
- Interface-based communication
- Unified `ActionTimer`
- Data-driven configuration fields
- Function map routing

## Notes
- The refactoring maintains backward compatibility where possible
- Legacy CombatComponent still exists but should be phased out
- All changes follow Unreal Engine best practices
- No GAS dependency maintained as per project requirements
