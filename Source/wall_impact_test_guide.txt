WALL IMPACT TESTING GUIDE - Sideways & All Directions
======================================================

KNOCKBACK DIRECTION SYSTEM
---------------------------
The knockback direction is calculated as:
Direction = (Enemy Position - Player Position).Normalized()

This means:
- Player on LEFT of enemy → Enemy knocked RIGHT
- Player on RIGHT of enemy → Enemy knocked LEFT  
- Player BEHIND enemy → Enemy knocked FORWARD
- Player in FRONT of enemy → Enemy knocked BACKWARD
- Any diagonal angle works too!

VISUAL DEBUG INDICATORS
------------------------
When you hit an enemy with heavy attack, you'll see:

1. **MAGENTA ARROW** (3 seconds)
   - Shows knockback direction from enemy
   - Length indicates direction of travel
   - Text shows force and direction values

2. **YELLOW SPHERE** (follows enemy)
   - Tracks enemy during flight
   - Shows collision detection radius
   - Updates position every frame

3. **IMPACT INDICATORS**:
   - RED sphere = Wall hit (vertical surface)
   - GREEN sphere = Floor hit (horizontal surface)
   - Shows exact impact location

TESTING SCENARIOS
-----------------

SCENARIO 1: Sideways into Wall
1. Position enemy next to a wall (left or right side)
2. Attack from opposite side (if enemy is by left wall, attack from right)
3. Enemy should fly sideways into wall
4. Expected: WALL impact, 2-second stagger

SCENARIO 2: Forward into Wall  
1. Position enemy in front of a wall
2. Attack from behind (you between enemy and open space)
3. Enemy should fly forward into wall
4. Expected: WALL impact, 2-second stagger

SCENARIO 3: Diagonal Impact
1. Position enemy near corner of two walls
2. Attack from diagonal angle
3. Enemy should hit whichever wall they reach first
4. Expected: WALL impact on first wall hit

SCENARIO 4: Open Area Knockback
1. Position enemy in open area
2. Heavy attack from any angle
3. Enemy should fly and hit ground
4. Expected: FLOOR impact, 1-second ragdoll

CONSOLE OUTPUT TO VERIFY
-------------------------
Successful wall impact from ANY angle should show:

```
Knockback Applied: Force=1000.0, Direction=(X, Y, Z), Ragdoll=Yes
Using character capsule for collision detection on BP_Enemy
[KNOCKBACK TRACKING] Started for BP_Enemy | Force: 1000.0
OnTargetHit Called! HitComponent: CapsuleComponent, OtherActor: Wall_BP
Hit detected! BlockingHit: Yes
========================================
KNOCKBACK IMPACT DETECTED!
  Type: WALL
  Surface Normal Z: 0.00  (or close to 0 for walls)
========================================
>>> WALL IMPACT EFFECTS APPLIED <<<
  - Stagger Duration: 2.0 seconds
```

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If sideways knockback isn't detecting walls:

1. Check wall collision is set to "BlockAll" or at minimum blocks Pawn
2. Verify the wall actor has collision enabled
3. Ensure knockback force is > 150 (heavy is 1000)
4. Check that enemy capsule collision is enabled during ragdoll

The system is direction-agnostic - any impact angle into a wall should trigger the stagger effect!

CONFIGURATION
-------------
In DamageCalculator component:
- KnockbackUpwardForce: Lower (0.1) for more horizontal travel
- RagdollKnockbackMultiplier: Higher (3.0) for stronger sideways impact
