KNOCKBACK & IMPACT DEBUG SYSTEM
================================

CONFIGURABLE KNOCKBACK FORCES (DamageCalculator)
-------------------------------------------------
You can now edit these in the DamageCalculator component in Blueprint:

1. KnockbackUpwardForce (default: 0.3)
   - Range: 0.0 to 1.0
   - Controls how much upward lift enemies get when knocked back
   - 0.0 = purely horizontal knockback
   - 0.3 = slight upward arc (default)
   - 1.0 = strong upward launch

2. RagdollKnockbackMultiplier (default: 2.0)
   - Range: 1.0 to 5.0
   - Multiplier for heavy attacks that cause ragdoll
   - 2.0 = double force for ragdoll knockbacks

3. StandardKnockbackMultiplier (default: 1.0)
   - Multiplier for regular (non-ragdoll) knockbacks
   - Can be adjusted for overall knockback strength

DEBUG LOGS
----------
When enemy is knocked back with force > 150, you'll see:

1. INITIAL KNOCKBACK LOG:
   "Knockback Applied: Force=500.0, Upward=0.30, Ragdoll=Yes"

2. TRACKING START:
   "[KNOCKBACK TRACKING] Started for BP_Enemy | Force: 500.0 | Threshold: 150.0"

3. IMPACT DETECTION:
   ========================================
   KNOCKBACK IMPACT DETECTED!
     Type: WALL or FLOOR or SLOPE
     Surface Normal Z: 0.00 (wall) or 1.00 (floor)
     Impact Location: X=100 Y=200 Z=50
     Impact Actor: Wall_Blueprint
     Debug Color: RED (wall) / GREEN (floor) / YELLOW (slope)
   ========================================

4. IMPACT EFFECTS:
   For WALL:
   >>> WALL IMPACT EFFECTS APPLIED <<<
     - Stagger Duration: 2.0 seconds
     - Bounce Force Applied
     - Wall Break VFX at: X=100 Y=200 Z=50

   For FLOOR:
   >>> FLOOR IMPACT EFFECTS APPLIED <<<
     - Ragdoll Duration: 1.0 seconds
     - Recovery Timer Started
     - Floor Impact at: X=100 Y=200 Z=0

DEBUG VISUALIZATION
-------------------
Visual debug elements (in editor with debug enabled):

1. TRACKING PHASE:
   - Yellow sphere (100 unit radius) around enemy during knockback
   - "TRACKING KNOCKBACK" text above enemy

2. WALL IMPACT:
   - Large RED sphere (75 units) at impact point
   - Orange arrow showing wall normal direction
   - Text showing "WALL IMPACT!\n2 sec stagger\nForce: 500"
   - Persists for 5 seconds

3. FLOOR IMPACT:
   - GREEN circle on ground (60 unit radius)
   - Medium GREEN sphere (40 units) at impact point
   - Text showing "FLOOR IMPACT!\n1 sec ragdoll\nForce: 500"
   - Persists for 3 seconds

SURFACE DETECTION
-----------------
- WALL: Surface normal Z < 0.3 (mostly vertical)
- FLOOR: Surface normal Z > 0.7 (mostly horizontal)
- SLOPE: Between 0.3-0.7 (currently just logged, no special handling)

HOW TO TEST
-----------
1. Open DamageCalculator in Blueprint editor
2. Adjust KnockbackUpwardForce (try 0.1 for low arc, 0.5 for high arc)
3. Adjust RagdollKnockbackMultiplier (try 3.0 for stronger heavy attacks)
4. Use heavy attack (E key) near walls or open areas
5. Watch console logs for impact detection
6. Observe visual debug spheres and text in editor

TUNING TIPS
-----------
- Lower KnockbackUpwardForce (0.1-0.2) for more horizontal, wall-seeking knockback
- Higher KnockbackUpwardForce (0.4-0.6) for more aerial juggle potential
- Increase RagdollKnockbackMultiplier for more dramatic heavy attacks
- Current threshold of 150 knockback force triggers tracking (heavy attacks are 500+)
