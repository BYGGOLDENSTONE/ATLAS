- 75-50: Minor Instability
  * Flickering lights affect visibility
  * Occasional micro-gravity moments
  * Sparking panels (visual only)
  
- 50-25: Major Instability  
  * Gravity wells appear randomly
  * Oxygen leaks create damage zones
  * Environmental hazards activate
  * Enemy AI becomes more aggressive
