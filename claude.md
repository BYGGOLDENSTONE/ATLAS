## Technical Rules
- NO GAS - Custom components only
- Data-Driven via DataAssets
- Animation-driven combat timing
- GameplayTags for all states
- `bCanBeInterrupted = false` for attacks

- **Components**: `/Source/Atlas/Components/`
- **Data Assets**: `/Source/Atlas/Data/`
- **Console Cmds**: `/Source/Atlas/Debug/`

2. Set up test map and player character
3. Implement UI widgets from C++ base classes
4. Create enemy blueprints for 5 room types
