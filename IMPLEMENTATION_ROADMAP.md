- Vulnerability system fully functional
- Wall impact bonus damage

### Phase 2: Reward System & Enemy AI ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE
- Complete reward system architecture
- SlotManagerComponent with 6 slots
- RunManagerComponent for room progression
- AIDifficultyComponent for adaptive enemies
- SaveManagerSubsystem for persistence
- Enemy scaling based on player power

### Phase 3: Content Framework & UI ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE
- RewardDataAssetFactory with 25 rewards defined
- RoomDataAssetFactory with 5 rooms configured  
- UI Widget framework (RewardSelection, SlotManager, RunProgress)
- 40+ console commands for testing
- Comprehensive documentation for content creation

### Phase 4: Environmental Systems & Interactables ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE (2025-01-22)
- IntegrityVisualizerComponent for station damage visuals
- Environmental hazard system (Electrical, Toxic, LowGravity)
- InteractableComponent base framework
- DestructibleEnvironmentComponent with debris
- StationDegradationSubsystem for progressive decay
- EmergencyEventManager for dynamic events
- 16+ console commands for testing

   - Marketing materials

## Technical Guidelines

### All implementations must follow:
1. **Component Architecture**: Use existing ActionManagerComponent system
2. **Data-Driven Design**: All values in DataAssets
3. **Interface Communication**: Use the 4 core interfaces
4. **Animation-Driven**: Combat timing via notifies
5. **No GAS**: Continue using custom component system
6. **Tag-Based Rules**: Use GameplayTags for all conditions

### Code Standards:
- Single responsibility components
- Interface-based communication
- No circular dependencies
- Comprehensive debug commands
- Clear separation of concerns

## Priority Notes
- **Phase 1-3**: Core gameplay loop (COMPLETE) ✅
- **Phase 4**: Environmental systems and interactables (COMPLETE) ✅
- **Phase 5-6**: Polish, optimization and audio (NEXT)
- **Phase 7-8**: Meta progression and platform features
- **Phase 9**: Final testing and release

## Next Immediate Steps (Phase 5)
1. Profile and identify performance bottlenecks
2. Implement object pooling for frequently spawned objects
3. Optimize particle systems and visual effects
4. Balance damage values and reward power scaling
5. Add final VFX passes and post-processing
